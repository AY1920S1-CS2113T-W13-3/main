By: `Team SGTravel`      Since: `Aug 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing#,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SGTravel branding and refer to the `AY1920S1-CS2113T-W13-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `AY1920S1-CS2113T-W13-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Documentation#Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about <<DeveloperGuide#Design-Architecture, SGTravel's architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of SGTravel. SGTravel adopts a n-tier style architecture where higher layers make use of services provided by lower layers. Here is a quick overview of each layer/component:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The user interface of the application
* <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>>: A collection of classes used by multiple other components
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The main controller of the entire application
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the application in-memory
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

The `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`SidePanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these `UI` parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/sgtravel/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Recives commannd results from `Logic` component so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.

Given below is the simplified activity diagram for the workflow of the `UI`. Upon the start of the `UI`, it would request for user input. Then, it would process the user input and execute the input. It would show the respective response after execution of the input. If the response requires calendar or map, it would show it to the user. Subsequently, it would loop back to request for user input again. Else, if the response is exit type, it would exit the app.

.Activity Diagram of the UI Component
image::UiActivityDiagram.png[width="700" align="left"]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="700" height="600" align="left"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/sgtravel/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `Parser` and `ConversationManager` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an event).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying calendar to the user.
. Furthermore, the `EditorManager` is allowed to "snatch" the user inputs from the `Parser` when it is activated.

Given below is the diagram illustrating the workflow of the `Logic` component. The user input is passed to `Logic` component. Then, it would determine the input is of single line type or complex multiple line type. If it is a multiple line type, it would start a `Conversation` with the user to prompt for more input. Then, using the input, it would build it to become a single line input to be passed to create a `Command`. In create command, figure at the bottom, the input is parsed to determine which command is to be built. Subsequently, the `Command` would be executed to create `CommandResult` which contains the response and result of the execution of the `Command`.

.Logic Activity diagram
image::LogicActivityDiagram.png[width="500" align="left"]

.CreateCommand Activity diagram
image::CreateCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="500" align="left"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="500" align="left"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/sgtravel/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `ProfileCard` object that represents the user's profile.
* stores the SGTravel data.
* the only class that is exposed to `Storage` component

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="450" align="left"]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `ProfileCard` objects in `.txt` format and read it back.
* can save the SGTravel data in `.txt` format and read it back.

The figure below shows some parts of the activity of `Storage` when it is initialised during the start of launching the SGTravel application. It will first read from event file path and parses it into `EventList` for `Storage`. Then it will read bus and train transport information and parses them into `TransportationMap` for `Storage`.

.Activity diagram for the Storage Component
image::StorageActivityDiagram.png[width="450" align="left"]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `sgtravel.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Handling user input

==== Implementation

.Sequence diagram of how user input is handled
image::HandleUserInputDiagram.png[width="800" align="left"]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how user input is handled:

.  The user types in a command into the terminal, and clicks on the kbd:[Enter] button.
.  Upon button press, the text in the input is read, if it is non-empty, the application will echo back the user’s input.
.  The `MainWindow` will then call `dukeResponse(input)`, which creates a thread using the `Platform` class.
.  A `CommandResult` object is created, and `dukeShow(result)` is called using this object.
.  If the result is of `CommandResultExit`, call `tryExitApp()`. Else if result is of `CommandResultCalender`, make a new `CalenderWindow` object with the result. Else if the result is of `CommandResultMap`, make a new `MapWindow` object.

=== Parsing of user input into command

==== Implementation

.Sequence diagram of how user input is parsed into a command
image::ParseCommandDiagram.png[width="800" align="left"]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how user input is handled:

.  If the input is identified as a single line command (e.g. `help`, `list`), the appropriate command is returned.
.  Else, call `getCommandFromConversationManager(userInput)`, which will cause the `ConversationManager` to call `converse(userInput)`.
.  In `ConversationManager`, `converse(userInput)` will check for the presence of a `Conversation`, and process the given user input to see if it is what the `Conversation` wants. For example, a `isDateInput(userInput)` will check if the given user input is a date, whereas an `isIntInput(userInput)` will check to see if it is an `Integer`). If it matches, an appropriate prompt is returned as a message, and the appropriate fields of the conversation is updated.
.  By checking if the `Conversation` in `ConversationManager` has ended, `parseComplexCommand(userInput)` will be called to try to parse the entire user input into a `Command`. Whereas if the `Conversation` has not ended, a `PromptCommand` is created by the `ConversationManager` using the `Conversation` and shown to the user.
.  The `LogicManager` will then execute the `Command` and return a `CommandResult` to the `Ui`.

.Sequence diagram of how Command is created by ConversationManager
image::ConversationDiagram.png[width="600" align="left"]

==== Design Considerations

===== **Aspect: How to allow both Single and Multi-step commands**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using `ConversationManager` to "accumulate" user input first before passing to `LogicManager` as a single step command when the accumulation is ready.
** Pros: No need to create new command classes.
** Pros: Can use the same key word to trigger both the single and multi-step commands based o the context.
** Pros: Does not block out single-step command even when the multi-step command is ongoing.
** Cons: Challenging to implement, exceptions need to be handled carefully.
* **Alternative 2:** Single and Multi-step commands are considered as different commands.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: We cannot use the same keywords to trigger both the multi-step and single-step command.
** Cons: There will be many different commands with overlapping code which violates DRY principle.
** Cons: Blocks out other commands while multi-step command is triggered.

=== Edit feature

==== Implementation

.Class diagram of QuickEditCommand
image::QuickEditCommandDiagram.png[]

The naive editing mechanism is facilitated by the `QuickEditCommand` from the `Logic` component.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the editing mechanism behaves at each step:

. The user calls the edit command with its relevant parameters. +
e.g. `e 1 Bukit Batok 12/02/29 14/02/29`

. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `Parser`.
. The `Parser` calls `QuickEditParser` and returns an `QuickEditCommand` Object.
. The `LogicManager` will call `execute()` on the `QuickEditCommand` object which interacts with and updates the `Model` component and return a `CommandResult` Object containing a message. If no `Event` of the corresponding index is found, it would return a string of message `MESSAGE_INVALID_EVENT_INDEX`.
. The `CommandResult` Object will then be given back to the `Ui` component which displays the success message.

Alternatively, the editing mechanism can be facilitated by the `EditorManager` and `Selectors` in the `Logic` Component. +
Below, is a diagram describing the work flow of the editing mechanism.

.Activity diagram for how Editing Mechanism works
image::EditActivityDiagram.png[width="600" align="left"]

The `EditorManager` object oversees the edit operation with the help of `Selectors` class which selects the `Event` and the components to be updated. The `EditorManager` contains an instance of `LocationSelector` and an `EventFieldSelector` which selects the index of the `Event` and the components of the `Event` respectively. +

The `EditorManager` object implements the following operations:

* `EditorManager+activate(EventList events, VenueList venues)` - Activates the `EditorManager`
* `EditorManager+isActive()` - Check if the `EditorManager` is active
* `EditorManager-deactivate()` - Deactivates the `EditorManager`
* `EditorManager+edit(String userInput)` - Updates the state of the editing process based on user input
* `EditorManager+edit(KeyEvent keyInput)` - Updates the state of the editing process based on user key press
* `EditorManager-selectEventField()` - Uses the `EventFieldSelector` to select a field within the `Event`
* `EditorManager-selectEvent()` - Uses the `LocationSelector` to select an `Event`

.Sequence diagram for how Editing Mechanism works
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[width="600" align="left"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the editing mechanism behaves at each step. +

. The user invokes the `EditorManager` by typing `edit` followed by the kbd:[enter] key.
. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `Parser`.
. The `Parser` breakdowns the user input into and returns an `EditorCommand` Object.
. The `LogicManager` will call `execute()` on the `EditorCommand` object which return a `CommandResult` Object containing a message and the `EventList` in the `Model` component.
. The `LogicManager` will then call `activate()` on the `EditorManager` object inside the `LogicManager` class. Upon activation, the user inputs will be passed to the `EditorManager` object through `edit()` instead until it is deactivated.
. The `EditorManager` will deactivate itself once the user input: `save` or `close`, which updates or discard the edits that were made respectively

Given below here is an example of how the `EditorManager` manages which `Event` and the corresponding field it should select:

Step 1. The user launches edit mode, the `EditorManager` is in a clean state and will simply select index 0 of the `Event` in the `EventList`.

.Diagram for edit state
image::EditState0.png[height="200" width="600"]

Step 2. User presses the kbd:[up] key. The `EditorManager` calls `feedKeyCode()` on the `LocationSelector` which will then find the nearest `Event` in the up direction and updates the index.

.Diagram for edit state
image::EditState1.png[height="200" width="600"]

Step 3. User presses the kbd:[enter] key which locks in on the `Event`. The `EditorManager` will again call `LocationSelector+feedKeyCode()`, and the `LocationSelector` will now lock itself, meaning that the arrow keys will no longer change the index.

Step 4. User presses the kbd:[down] key. The `EditorManager` will now call `EventFieldSelector+feedKeyCode()`, and the `EventFieldSelector` will return an index pointing to a field within the `Event`.

.Diagram for edit state
image::EditState2.png[width="400" align="left"]

Step 5. The user now inputs: `09/11/20`. The `EditorManager` will now call `Editor+edit()` which edits the event2’s startDate from `30/10/19` to `09/11/20`.

==== Design Considerations

===== **Aspect:  How edit executes**

* **Alternative 1:** The user inputs a specific command instruction and SGTravel executes it
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Difficult for user to learn, hard to make mass edits
* **Alternative 2:** The user use arrow, enter keys to navigate around the events and edit directly
** Pros: Straightforward to use, allow mass edits
** Cons: Difficult to implement

===== **Aspect:  Data structures to support edit operation**

* **Alternative 1:** An `EditCommand` to edit
** Pros: No changes are required on Logic and easy for anyone with knowledge of OOP to understand
** Cons: Does not allow for flexibility on the user’s end as it takes in only strict inputs that adhered to the format

* **Alternative 2:** Using `EditorManager` to edit
** Pros: Does not violate separation of concerns and Single responsibility principle as it only deals with edit operation
** Cons: Require many accessory classes to reduce coupling and increase cohesion within the `EditorManager` itself

===== **Aspect:  Integration of the data structures into the architecture**

* **Alternative 1:** `EditCommand`
** Pros: Require minimal changes to the code
** Cons: Does not demonstrate student’s understanding of software engineering

* **Alternative 2:** `EditManager`
** Pros: Requires much more data structures, where SOLID principles can be demonstrated
** Cons: Changes need to be made to entire architecture

=== Route Feature

==== Implementation

SGTravel allows users to plan and customize routes to assist in travelling around. Multiple transportation options are covered, allowing for flexibility in planning. The `Route` planning mechanism is facilitated by the `RouteList`. This section will document the implementation of the `Route` feature and its various components. Included below is the class diagram for `RouteList`:

.RouteList class diagram
image::SGTravel_RouteList_class_diagram.png[height="400" width="700"]

`Route` objects are stored in the `RouteList`. Each `Route` object itself represents a list of `RouteNode` objects that correspond to physical locations in an area. Below is the class diagram of a `Route` object:

.Route class diagram
image::SGTravel_Route_class_diagram.png[height="250" width="400"]

`RouteNode` is an abstract class extending the Venue class. `RouteNode` itself is extended by the `BusStop`, `TrainStation` and `CustomNode` objects. Below is the class diagram of these classes:

.RouteNode class diagram
image::SGTravel_RouteNode_class_diagram.png[height="560" width="930"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Model`,`RouteList` and `Route` behaves at each step when trying to add a new `Route` to SGTravel:

.  The user calls the `RouteAddCommand` with its relevant parameters. +
e.g. `routeAdd Go to Sentosa`
. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `Parser`.
. The `Parser` breakdowns the user input into and returns an `RouteAddCommand` Object.
. The `LogicManager` will call `execute()` on the `RouteAddCommand` object which return a `CommandResultText` Object containing a message.
. During the `execute()` method, the `RouteList` is obtained by calling the `getRoutes()` method in the `Model`.
. A new `Route` is created with the relevant parameters and is added to the `RouteList` via the `add()` method in the `RouteList`.
. The method `save()` is invoked in the `Model`, and a `CommandResultText` object is created with an appropriate message to show that the command has been executed properly.

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the various components work in the `execute()` method of the `RouteNodeAdd` command:

.Sequence diagram for the execute() method in RouteAddCommand
image::SGTravel_routeAdd_diagram.png[height="640" width="1400"]

Should the user want to edit a Route, the `RouteEditCommand` can be used. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Model`, `RouteList` and `Route` objects behave at each step:

.  The user calls the `RouteEditCommand` with its relevant parameters. +
e.g. `routeEdit 1 name Go to MBS`
. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `Parser`.
. The `Parser` breakdowns the user input into and returns an `RouteEditCommand` Object.
. The `LogicManager` will call `execute()` on the `RouteEditCommand` object which return a `CommandResultText` Object containing a message.
. During the `execute()` method, the `RouteList` is obtained by calling the `getRoutes()` method in the `Model`.
. The `Route` that is going to be edited is obtained through calling the `get()` method in the `RouteList` with the given index parameter.
. The `editField()` method of the `RouteEditCommand` is invoked, which will call either `setName()` or `setDescription()` in the `Route` object, with the appropriate parameter. If an invalid field is given, an `UnknownFieldException` is thrown, which will be caught by the `MainWindow` object later on.
. The method `save()` is invoked in the `Model`, and a `CommandResultText` object is created with an appropriate message to show that the command has been executed properly.

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the various components work in the `execute()` method of the `RouteEditCommand` command:

.Sequence diagram for the execute() method in RouteEditCommand
image::SGTravel_routeEdit_diagram.png[height="950" width="1380"]

The user can also add different `RouteNode` objects to a `Route`. This can be done with the `RouteNodeAddCommand`. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Model`, `RouteList`, `Route` and `RouteNode` object behave at each step:

.  The user calls the `RouteNodeAddCommand` with its relevant parameters. +
e.g. `routeNodeAdd 1 1 at 17009 by bus`
. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `Parser`.
. The `Parser` breakdowns the user input into and returns an `RouteNodeAddCommand` Object.
. The `RouteNodeAddCommand` object will contain a new `RouteNode` object which is created from the `createRouteNode()` method in the `RouteNodeAddParser` object. The `createRouteNode()` method will parse through the given user input, and call the `getRouteNode()` method if the input is in the correct format.
. Depending on the user input, a `BusStop`, `TrainStation` or `CustomNode` object will be created, and the `RouteNodeAddCommand` will contain this new object.
. The `LogicManager` will call `execute()` on the `RouteNodeAddCommand` object which return a `CommandResultImage` Object containing a message and an image of the map at that location.
. During the `execute()` method, the `fetchNodeData()` method is invoked to try to get the full information about the new `RouteNode` object. If this fails, a `CommandResultImage` object with the appropriate error message will be returned.
. The `addToRoute()` method of the `RouteNodeAddCommand` is invoked. The `Route` that the new `RouteNode` is being add to, is obtained through calling the `getRoute()` method in the `Model` with the given index parameter. The `RouteNode` is added to the `Route` by invoking the `addNode()` method in the `Route` with the given index parameter for the `RouteNode`.
. The method `save()` is invoked in the `Model`, and a `RouteNodeShowCommand` is created with the index parameters of this `RouteNode`. The `execute()` method of this `RouteNodeShowCommand` is invoked, to create a new `CommandResultImage` object, which contains a message showing that the `RouteNode` has been added. This `CommandResultImage` also contains the image of the map of the `RouteNode`. The `RouteNodeShowCommand` will be explained later on.

.Activity diagram for the execute() method in RouteNodeAddCommand
image::SGTravel_routeNodeAdd_diagram.png[height="1150" width="850"]

The user can also show the map of a `RouteNode` by using the `RouteNodeShowCommand`. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Model`, `RouteList`, `Route` and `RouteNode` object behave at each step:

.  The user calls the `RouteNodeShowCommand` with its relevant parameters. +
e.g. `routeNodeShow 1 1`
. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `Parser`.
. The `Parser` breakdowns the user input into and returns an `RouteNodeShowCommand` Object.
. During the `execute()` method, the `Route` that the `RouteNode` that is being shown is obtained by calling the `getRoute()` method in the `Model`. By calling `getNode()` on the `Route`, the `RouteNode` being shown will be obtained.
. The `generateRouteNodeShow()` method is called in the `ApiParser` class. This method constructs a string from the parameters of the `RouteNode` object, and obtains an `Image` object from the `getStaticMap` method in the `ApiParser`.
. A `StaticMapUrlRequest` object is created, which will send a request to the OneMap API. The API returns an `Image` object back to the `StaticMapUrlRequest`, which will return the object back to the `ApiParser`. This `Image` is returned back to the `RouteNodeShowCommand` object, which will then return a `ComandResultImage` object with the `Image` and the parameters of the `RouteNode`.

.Activity diagram for the execute() method in RouteNodeShowCommand
image::SGTravel_routeNodeShow_diagram.png[height="1150" width="850"]

The user can also show the map of a `RouteNode` and nearby `BusStop` and `TrainStation` objects by using the `RouteNodeNearbyCommand`. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Model`, `RouteList`, `Route` and `RouteNode` object behave at each step:

.  The user calls the `RouteNodeNearbyCommand` with its relevant parameters. +
e.g. `routeNodeNearby 1 1`
. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `Parser`.
. The `Parser` breakdowns the user input into and returns an `RouteNodeShowCommand` Object.
. During the `execute()` method, the `Route` that the `RouteNode` that is being shown is obtained by calling the `getRoute()` method in the `Model`. By calling `getNode()` on the `Route`, the `RouteNode` being shown will be obtained.
. The list of nearby `RouteNode` (`BusStop` and `TrainStation`) are obtained by calling the `getNeighbour()` method in the `ApiParser` class.
. The `generateStaticMapNeighbours()` method is called in the `ApiParser` class. This method constructs a string from the parameters of the `RouteNode` object and the list of nearby `RouteNodes`, and obtains an `Image` object from the `getStaticMap` method in the `ApiParser`.
. A `StaticMapUrlRequest` object is created, which will send a request to the OneMap API. The API returns an `Image` object back to the `StaticMapUrlRequest`, which will return the object back to the `ApiParser`. This `Image` is returned back to the `RouteNodeNearbyCommand` object, which will then return a `ComandResultImage` object with the `Image` and list of nearby `RouteNodes`.

.Activity diagram for the execute() method in RouteNodeShowCommand
image::SGTravel_routeNodeNearby_diagram.png[height="1290" width="850"]

The user can also automatically generate a new `Route` by using the `RouteGenerateCommand`. Given below is an exmample usage scenario and how the `Model`, `RouteList` and `PathFinder` object behave at each step.

.  The user calls the `RouteGenerateCommand` with its relevant parameters. +
e.g. `routeGenerate amk hub to nus by bus`
. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `Parser`.
. The `Parser` breakdowns the user input into and returns an `RouteGenerateCommand` Object.
. The `generateRoute()` method is called in the `RouteGenerateCommand`. It invokes the `getLocationSearch()` method in the `ApiParser` class for the 2 given location parameters. This creates 2 `Venue` objects corresponding to the starting and ending points of this `Route`. These 2 objects are passed into the `execute()` method in the `PathFinder` object that is constructed in this method. This `execute()` method will return a list of `Venue` objects corresponding to the transfer points that the Route will have.
. A new `Route` object is created, and all the `Venue` objects are iterated through. For each pair of `Venue` objects in the list, `addInbetweenNodes()` is invoked from the `RouteGenerateCommand`, which creates all the `RouteNode` objects that exist between these 2 transfer points and inserts them into the new `Route`. `addEndingNode()` is then invoked to add the `Venue` objects as `RouteNode` objects to the `Route`.
. The `RouteList` is obtained by invoking `getRoutes()` in the `Model`, and the new `Route` is added via the `add()` method in the `RouteList`.
. The method `save()` is invoked in the `Model`, and a `CommandResultText` object is created and returned.

==== Design Considerations

===== **Aspect:  How RouteNodes are stored**

* **Alternative 1:** `RouteNode` is stored as an object.
** Pros: Easy to edit and interact with.
** Cons: Requires making a `BusStop`, `TrainStation` and `CustomNode` object, as all 3 items have different properties.

* **Alternative 2:** `RouteNode` would be stored as a String instead, and is broken up into its individual parts when manipulated.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Prone to errors in breaking up the String because of its contents, and hard to maintain.

===== **Aspect:  How Routes are stored**

* **Alternative 1:** A `RouteList` object holds several Routes in an ArrayList. 
** Pros: Easy to interact with and modify a `Route`. Keeps the `Model` simple.
** Cons: Will require more work to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** `Routes` would be located in an ArrayList in the SGTravel’s model.
** Pros: Quick and easy to implement.
** Cons: Limited ability to manipulate a `Route`. Additional manipulation commands will bloat up the model.

==== [Proposed] Route Manager

The completed Route feature would include a `RouteManager` class in v2.0. The `RouteManager` will be similar to the `EditorManager` class, and will be activated by entering a specific command. With the `RouteManager` turned on, ther user interacts in multi-step commands instead. In order to simplify the user experience, the `Route` and `RouteNode` that the user wants to interact with, are stored in the `RouteManager`. Commands entered will directly affect the `Route` and `RouteNode` stored in the `RouteManager`, and the user can easily change the `Route` and `RouteNode` that are selected by commands too. A saving feature as seen in the `EditorManager` class will also be implemented, allowing the user to easily save or discard changes. 

=== Itinerary Feature

==== Implementation

SGTravel facilitates the user to create itineraries for their Singapore trip either from scratch or based on recommendations given. The user can then store these itineraries and access them at any time leading to effective trip planning and scheduling. This section will document the implementation of the `Itinerary` feature and its various components. The `Itinerary` feature is facilitated by the `Itinerary` class as well as the commands outlined below. Below is the class diagram for `Itinerary`:

.The class diagram for `Itinerary` and associated classes

image::SGTravel_Itinerary_class_diagram.png[height="500" width="800"]



As can be seen from the diagram above. The main `Itinerary` class has different fields such as the `startDate` and `endDates` (to calculate the number of days) and a list of `Agenda`. Here the `Agenda` class models the activities and locations to be seen in one day. Hence, it contains a list of `Todos` and extends `VenueList`. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `newItinerary` mechanism behaves at each step:

.  The user calls the `NewItineraryCommand` with its relevant parameters. +
e.g. `newItinerary 23/04/20 24/04/20 NewItinerary 1 /venue MBS /do sightseeing /and eating.`
. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `Parser`.
. The `Parser` calls `CreateNewItineraryParser` and returns an `NewItineraryCommand` object and passes the created itinerary in its constructor.
. The `LogicManager` will call `execute()` on the `NewItineraryCommand` object which interacts with and stores the new itinerary in the `Model`.
. The method `save()` is invoked in the `Model`, and a `CommandResultText` object is created with an appropriate message to show that the command has been executed properly and the itinerary has been created.
. If no `Itinerary` is created, it would return a message string `MESSAGE_ITINERARY_FAIL_CREATION`.

The activity diagram given below shows how the `NewItineraryCommand` interacts with the `Model` interface to save the new `Itinerary`. 

.Activity diagram for the execute() method in newItineraryCommand
image::SGTravel_newItinerary_Command_diagram.png[height="640" width="700"]


Alternatively, the creation of itineraries can be facilitated by the `RecommendationsCommand` and the `AddListCommand`. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Recommendation` mechanism behaves and interacts with the `Model`:

.  The user calls the `RecommendationsCommand` with its relevant parameters. +
e.g. `recommend itinerary between 23/04/20 and 24/04/20`
. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `RecommendationsCommandParser`. 
. The `RecommendationsCommandParser` returns a `RecommendationsCommand` object and passes the relevant array of date details. 
. The `LogicManager` will call `execute()` on the `RecommendationsCommand` object which returns a `CommandResultText` object containing the recommended itinerary. 
. During the `execute()` method a recommendation object containing all of SGTravel's possible locations is created.
. The recommendation object then calls on the `makeItinerary()` function. This then returns an itinerary object contains details of a recommended trip of the specified length. If more than 9 days are entered a `RecommendationsFailException` is passed.
. This returned recommended itinerary is then stored into the `Model` component via the `setRecentItinerary()` method. This makes the recommendation easily accessible to the `addThisList` command. 
. A `CommandResultText` object is created with an appropriate message to show that the command has been executed properly.


Given below is the sequence diagram of how the various components work in the `execute()` method of the `RecommendationsCommand` command:

.Sequence diagram for the execute() method in RecommendationsCommand

image::SGTravel_recommend_command_diagram.png[height="750" width="980"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `AddList` mechanism behaves and interacts in the `Model` after a `Recommendation` has been added :

.  The user calls the `AddThisListCommand` with its relevant parameters. +
e.g. `addThisList MyNewVacation`
. The `LogicManager` parses the user input using the `Parser`.
. The `Parser` returns a `AddThisListCommand` object and passes the relevant newName with it. 
. The `LogicManager` will call `execute()` on the `AddThisListCommand` object which returns a `CommandResultText` object containing the newly added recommendation in full.
. During the `execute()` method the recommendation given most recently is retrieved from storage. If no recent recommendation is present a `NoRecentItineraryException` is returned.
. The `confirmRecentItinerary()` method is called. This saves the current recommendation with the new name entered.
. The `setRecentItinerary()` sets the recentItinerary (recommendation) to null so that the same recommendation cannot be added twice.
. The method `save()` is invoked in the `Model`, and a `CommandResultText` object is created with an appropriate message to show the stored itinerary has succeeded 

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the various components work in the `execute()` method of the `AddThisListCommand` command:

.Sequence diagram for the execute() method in RecommendationsCommand

image::SGTravel_addList_command_diagram.png[height="750" width="980"]


Other helper commands such as:
`listItinerary`, `showItinerary` and `doneItinerary` have not been shown here as they are simple text displaying commands. These commands offer an important interface to the user so that they can manage and create itineraries with greater ease.

==== Design Considerations

===== **Aspect:  How a new Itinerary is entered**

* **Alternative 1:** Currently, `newItinerary` command offers a one-shot command alternative.
** Pros: It does not require line by line entering of potentially long lists
** Pros: Better for CLI Users.
** Cons: It is prone to many parsing errors and is restrictive on the user
** Cons: Not as user friendly as a GUI or Multi-Line command.
* **Alternative 2:** Through a GUI Interface.
** Pros:  Much easier for the user to use. Gives insight as to where these locations might be
** Cons: Not command line based
** Cons: Cumbursome to implement. 

===== **Aspect:  How SGTravel Recommends a List**

* **Alternative 1:** Currently, the `recommend` command offers only a fixed recommendation.
** Pros: Easy to implement and good for first time visitors.
** Cons: Restrictive on the user as they cannot edit the recommendation.
* **Alternative 2:** Option to update list before saving
** Pros: User has greater freedom.
** Cons: Difficult to implement. 

==== [Proposed] Itinerary Builder Command

The completed itinerary feature would allow the user to create an itinerary as if they were engaging in a conversation with SGTravel. This process would also allow the user to edit the itinerary before confirming and storing it. The app would use an algorithm to find the nearest attractions to the user's hotel stay. The activity diagram for this feature is given below:

.Activity diagram for the Itinerary Builder command 
image::SGTravel_v.20_newItinerary_builder_diagram.png[height="550" width="680"]

There are two main additions coming in v2.0 are :

. Recommendations based on `hotel location`

. `Edit` feature during and after itinerary creation. 
 

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.

* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Logger.GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME)`
* Log level can be indicated using `logger.log(Level.INFO, MESSAGE)` which logs messages according to the log level

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
