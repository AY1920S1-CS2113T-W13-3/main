== Introduction

SGTravel is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for scheduling tasks*. SGTravel is also able to provide all sort of information about Singapore. Regardless whether you are a tourist or a local, SGTravel is the best application for planning your vacation plans in Singapore! More importantly, SGTravel is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SGTravel can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
